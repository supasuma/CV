## Summer Brines

I am a former career hopping, travel obsessed, frisbee playing kiwi-brit who is developing her niche in the world of coding.  I have developed a keen sense of self through my career and world exploration, whilst cultivating a passion for learning (and having fun doing it!). 

I am looking for a Junior Full Stack Developer role where my learning is encouraged and nutured, in an organisation that sees  value in cultivating a fun work environment. 


## Skills

### Communication

**_Recruitment / HR roles_**

Inherintly these roles required frequent and effective communication between candidates and the company.  Having spent approximately 4 years in these types of roles I have developed an ease in communicating with people from a variety of backgrounds on a daily basis.

**_Supply / Temp roles_**

While working as a temp/supply employee one needs to communicate effectively, particularly asking the right questions, in order to fit in as quickly and seemlessly as possible.  I found this particularly true when working as a Teaching Assistant at a school for children with severe & profound learning difficulties.  You are given no training or orientation, the only way to ensure your performance is through effective communication, both with staff and students. I believe the offer of a permanent supply role demonstrates my good communication.  Equally, I was asked to stay on in my other temp role as a site secretary/project administrator at Overbury, a London construction firm.

**_Project based roles_**

As a project manager at an established tech start-up (WM360) effective written and spoken communication was essential in keeping the project on track and clients informed.  Communication with clients took the form of weekly highlight reports and phone calls where ever necessary. When a project ran into an issue this was communicated immediately with client so there were no surprises.  For instance a project we were running at a discount for Guiness Partnerships began to run over budget due mainly to our lack of access to their staging environment and resulting bugs.  Thus I had to diplomatically communicate that we could no longer accommodate changes without incurring a cost.    


#### Adaptability

This is well demonstrated by my ability to work across industries, both in permanent and temporay roles, and fit in with the culture. From construction, to finance, to education, to tech I have been able to assimilate easily and communicate effectively.  


#### Fast Learner
This can't be better demonstrated than by my progress at Makers Academy after only 6 weeks.  In this time I have learnt the bones of two programming languages and am able to build some simplistic (but awesome) applications. After a week of learning javascript I was able to build a simple air bnb replica (<https://github.com/supasuma/makers-bnb>) as part of a team and this bowling app in a weekend <https://github.com/supasuma/bowling-challenge>.  NOTE TO SELF:NEED TO UPDATE READMES!!!
