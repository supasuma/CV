## Summer Brines

I am a former career hopping, travel obsessed, frisbee playing kiwi-brit who is developing her niche in the world of coding.  I have developed a keen sense of self through my career and world exploration, whilst cultivating a passion for learning (and having fun doing it!). 

I am looking for a Junior Full Stack Developer role where my learning is encouraged and nutured, in an organisation that sees  value in cultivating a fun work environment. 


## Skills

#### Communication

Across my career I have adapted to very different environments and communicated effectively. 

##### Project based roles

As a project manager at an established tech start-up (WM360) effective written and spoken communication was essential in keeping the project on track and clients informed.  Communication with clients took the form of weekly highlight reports and phone calls whereever necessary.

##### Recruitment / HR roles

##### Supply / Temp roles

While working as a temp/supply employee one needs to communicate effectively, particularly asking the right questions, in order to fit in as quickly and seemlessly as possible.  I found this particularly true when working as a Teaching Assistant at a school for children with severe & profound learning difficulties.  You are given no training or orientation, the only way to ensure your performance is through effective communication, both with staff and students. I believe the offer of a permanent supply role demonstrates my good communication.  Equally, I was asked to stay on in my other temp role as a site secretary/project administrator at Overbury, a London construction firm.
