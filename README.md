## Summer Brines

I am a worlds level [Ultimate Frisbee] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLXezM3b14) playing kiwi-brit with a diverse background beginning to forge my path in the world of coding.  I have developed a keen sense of self through my career and world exploration while feeding my passion for learning and self-improvement. 

I am looking for a Junior Full Stack Developer role where my learning is encouraged and nurtured, in an organisation that sees value in cultivating a fun work environment. 


## Skills

### Communication

* A diversity of roles and environments has cultivated an effective and adaptive communication style.  
* Recruitment/HR roles (3.5 years) inherently require frequent and effective communication between candidates and the company, including interviewing.
* As a supply Teaching Assistant in a school for children with severe & profound learning difficulties I was given no training or orientation, to ensure high performance communication was a necessity. An offer of a permanent supply role in this case demonstrates my effective communication. 
* As a Junior Project Manager at an established tech start-up (WM360) effective written and spoken communication was essential and took the form of weekly highlight reports and phone calls where ever necessary. In one case where we were running at a discount for a client (Guinness Partnerships) it was necessary that I diplomatically communicate we could no longer accommodate changes without incurring a cost. This was accepted without incident.     


### Adaptability

* This is well demonstrated by my ability to work across industries, both in permanent and temporary roles, and fit in with the culture. From construction, to finance, to education and tech I have been able to assimilate easily and communicate effectively.  
* My adaptability can also be demonstrated in a sporting environment, for instance at the most recent world championships in London. As a London-based player I had to train away from my NZ womens team and quickly assimilate into the team struture the 2 weeks leading up to the week long competition.  As the teams second highest point scorer I think this went well (I'm not really as cocky as this sounds!?). 


### Fast Learner
* This can't be better demonstrated than by my progress at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/) a 12 week coding boot camp.  During this time I have learnt the bones of two programming languages (Ruby & Javascript) and am able to build some awesome applications. 
* After a week of learning Javascript my team and I were able to build a simple [air bnb replica] (https://github.com/supasuma/makers-bnb), the following week we built [code farm] (https://code-farm.herokuapp.com/) a web app to assist children's learning code and over the weekend I built a simple [bowling app] (https://github.com/supasuma/bowling-challenge).

## Interests
I love to travel!  For the last 8 years or so I have had a serious travel bug which can explain some intriguing gaps in my CV - no regrets!  I am a passionate player of Ultimate Frisbee and compete at a national and international level.  I have been to 8 world championships in the past 10 years and hope to attend many more!  I like to dabble with my creative side, notable mentions being a paper mache zebra head & pillow depicting an NZ scene in felt.
