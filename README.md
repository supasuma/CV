## Summer Brines

I am a worlds level [Ultimate Frisbee](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLXezM3b14) playing kiwi-brit with a diverse background looking for a Ruby/JavaScript Junior Full Stack Developer role.  I would love to be part of an organisation that sees value in cultivating a fun work environment and supports each other.  Through my career and world exploration I have developed a keen sense of self and have a strong desire to succeed on my new path. 

## Skills

### Communication

* A diversity of roles and environments has cultivated an effective and adaptive communication style.  
* Recruitment/HR roles (3.5 years) inherently require frequent and effective communication between candidates and the company, including interviewing.
* As a supply Teaching Assistant in a school for children with severe & profound learning difficulties I was given no training or orientation, to ensure high performance communication was a necessity. Upon completion of this contract I was asked to stay on in a permanent supply role. 
* As a Junior Project Manager at an established tech start-up (WM360) effective written and spoken communication was essential and took the form of weekly highlight reports and phone calls where ever necessary. In one case where we were running at a discount for a client (Guinness Partnerships) it was necessary that I diplomatically communicate we could no longer accommodate changes without incurring a cost. This was accepted without incident.     


### Adaptability

* This is well demonstrated by my ability to work across industries, both in permanent and temporary roles. From construction, to finance, to education and tech I have been able to assimilate easily and communicate effectively.  
* Furthermore, at the most recent world championships I was a London-based player in my NZ womens team.  This meant I needed to quickly assimilate into the team struture within the 2 weeks leading up to the week-long competition.  As the teamâ€™s second highest point scorer I think this went well (I'm not really as cocky as this sounds!?). 


### Fast Learner
* This can't be better demonstrated than by my progress at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/) a 12-week coding boot camp.  During this time, I have learnt the bones of two programming languages (Ruby & JavaScript) and am able to build some awesome applications. 
* After a week of learning JavaScript my team and I were able to build a simple [air bnb replica] (https://github.com/supasuma/makers-bnb).  More achievements are detailed below.

## Interests
I love to travel!  For the last 8 years or so I have had a serious travel bug which can explain some intriguing gaps in my CV - no regrets!  I am a passionate player of Ultimate Frisbee and compete at a national and international level.  I have been to 8 world championships in the past 10 years and hope to attend many more!  I like to dabble with my creative side, notable mentions being a paper mache zebra head & pillow depicting an NZ scene in felt.
